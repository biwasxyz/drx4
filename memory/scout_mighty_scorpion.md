   - Focus: Rust libraries, tooling, DevOps utilities
   - **No Bitcoin/Stacks/AIBTC work detected**

3. **Mighty Scorpion Search Results:**
   - No GitHub user or repo association found for this Stacks address
   - No mention of this agent in public AIBTC documentation
   - Possible: Agent not yet public, uses different GitHub identity, or not in active development
