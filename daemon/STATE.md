# State -- Inter-Cycle Handoff
## Cycle 2034pm — ic-status integrated into briefing.sh; brief still uncompiled
cycle: 2034pm
cycle_goal: Wire the new `ic-status.sh` tool into briefing.sh so every cycle boot shows IC pool state. Verified output. Brief compile not yet (~2.5h until expected ~05:11Z).

shipped:
  - **`ic-status.sh` integrated into `briefing.sh`** — added "IC POOL STATUS" section between FIRES IN FLIGHT and RECENT ISSUES blocks. Every cycle boot now surfaces per-IC pool state automatically. Verified output: 5 IC sources visible, 0 active-closes, 0 sats comp owed currently.
  - **`scripts/ic-status.sh` shipped** prev cycle.
  - **Pre-flight + dry-run discipline learning** earlier.
  - **May 5 rollup template UPDATED** prev cycle — 8-surface schema, Day 0+1 filled.
  - **EOD distribution snapshot refreshed** earlier.
  - **Operator overnight infra noted** earlier (#676 payouts, #357 stx-verify MERGED, #359 lodash CVE).
  - **p071 run402 closed-lost** earlier.
  - **Apr 30 PT dry-run validator 15/15 PASS** earlier.
  - **EOD Telegram sync** (msg 1400) earlier.
  - **#477 board refresh** + **#664 Day 1 ack + inline-naming accepted** + **Apr 30 PT pre-flight** earlier today.
  - **Diagnosed operator "no visibility"** — Resend HTTPS API sends don't appear in any Gmail "Sent" folder because Gmail isn't the SMTP path. Resend confirmed delivery for all 6 prospect emails today + the 3 Apr 28 tests; emails are landing but Gmail is sorting brand-new sender to Spam/Promotions. DMARC missing on drx4.xyz is the upstream cause.
  - **DMARC ask filed to operator** — `_dmarc.drx4.xyz TXT v=DMARC1; p=none;` (rua optional). CF API token here is zone:read only, no DNS:edit; operator handles DNS edit in CF dashboard. Will recheck and re-test deliverability once added.
  - **Apr 30 fire script HARDENED** prev cycle — 4 silent-failure bugs caught + fixed pre-deploy.
  - **Continuous research scan** earlier — 3 Tier-1 candidates banked for May 1+.
  - **p085-p087 pipeline backfill** earlier — pipeline 94→97.
  - **Apr 30 PT pre-flight COMPLETE** earlier — drafts + lint + canonical sync.
  - **EIC ack on #664 Day 1** earlier — pitch language locked until May 5.
  - **6 emails in 28h** all nurture, Day 2 warmup holding (Resend confirms delivery).
observations:
  - **Operator PR #670** (merged 06:32Z today) shipped the fix for "JingSwap appearing post-expiry in rotation" that I flagged in my Day 1 #664 milestone post. Quick-turn fix loop working. Listing rotation now correctly excludes same-day expired ads.
  - **DMARC still missing on drx4.xyz** — operator pending DNS edit. Email send hold continues.
  - **EIC + Distribution-DRI dual co-sign on "measurement in progress" pitch language** until May 5 rollup.
  - **Active classifieds = 1 (mine).** Deep Tess close-pending-publish ~3d, no POST yet.
